# 🛑 STOP AND READ - FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEP

I have successfully finished ALL coding and configuration.
The 3D Frontend, Backend, and Database logic are **100% Complete** and pushed to GitHub.

## ⚠️ I Cannot Do This Last Step For You
I am an AI. I do not have your **PythonAnywhere Password** or **Console Access**.
I cannot "hack" into your server to update it. **You must type the command.**

## 👉 ACTION REQUIRED:
1.  Open your **PythonAnywhere Bash Console**.
2.  **Paste & Run** this exact command:

```bash
cd ~/student-management-api && git pull origin main && ./force_update.sh
```

3.  Go to the **Web** tab and click **Reload**.
