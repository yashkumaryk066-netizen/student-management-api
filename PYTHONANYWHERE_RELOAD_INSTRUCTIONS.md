# 🟢 Final Step: Reload Live Server

Great news! The updates have been **Successfully Pushed** to your GitHub repository.

To make these changes visible on your live site (`yashamishra.pythonanywhere.com`), you need to trigger a reload in your PythonAnywhere console.

### 📋 Instructions:
1.  Go to your **PythonAnywhere Web Tab**.
2.  Click the big green **"Reload yashamishra.pythonanywhere.com"** button.

### 🚀 What will happen?
*   The "MEET THE DEVELOPER" button will appear on the landing page.
*   The new Premium Developer Dashboard will be accessible.
*   The optimized, clean codebase will be running live.

(Note: Since I don't have direct access to click that button inside your PA account, you just need to do this one click!)
