## Objection Handling

### "Too expensive"

**Response**: "Try our 7-day free trial! If not satisfied, 100% money back. But 98% of our clients renew every year."

### "Seems complicated"
**Response**: "We've made it so simple that even non-tech teachers use it daily. Plus, we provide 2-hour training and lifetime support!"

### "Our internet is slow"
